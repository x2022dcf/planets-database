# 🌍 Planets Database

This repository is a practice project for learning Git and GitHub workflows using GitHub Desktop and VS Code. It contains a simple database of information about planets in our solar system and demonstrates how to create repositories, organize files, make commits, and sync changes with GitHub.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **inner-planets/**  
  Text files containing facts about Mercury and Venus.

- **outer-planets/**  
  Text files containing facts about outer planets such as Jupiter and Saturn.

- **data/**  
  - `planet-stats.csv`: A CSV file with basic planetary statistics including distance from the Sun, diameter, and number of moons.  
  - `fun-facts.txt`: A collection of interesting and fun facts about planets in our solar system.

## 🪐 Project Overview

Each planet file includes 3–5 facts, while the CSV file provides a structured, data-driven view of key planetary characteristics. The project is built incrementally using multiple commits to practice good version control habits.

## 🌟 Fun Planet Fact

A day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus — it takes longer for Venus to rotate once on its axis than it does to orbit the Sun!
